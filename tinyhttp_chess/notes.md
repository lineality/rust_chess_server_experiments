Q: can gamephrase be optional?

Game Logic:
1. get input via 'get' url direct text input
game_name/move/gamephrase
get IP of user (to not require gamephrase again)

2. check that game is set up: if not, then set game up.
- make game folder

3. check if move is same as last move
if same, do nothing

4. check move input is legal syntax

5. make move

6. record move in game_log (whatever the name is) file (in taht game's directory)

7. record move in last-move file (in that game's directory)

8. record time-stamp of last move (in that game's directory)

(game-data json?)

9. export as html, not raw text...


don't use "wrap"

fix how games are set up.

maybe 
setup/game_name/start
setup/game_name/report
setup/game_name/game_phrase

if blank...show current game board...
print last move from log...
or print log below board...


.................


todo:
- save inputs to use them in various ways

1. check format
2. update board

- check input

filter out incorrect input format
- show html unicode
- 

output html unicode

createimage overlay system, or composite image system,


new game check

reload game progress

Below are some suggestions to improve the provided Rust code:

Error handling: Instead of using unwrap(), which could potentially cause a panic if the Result or Option is Err or None respectively, it would be more robust to handle the errors gracefully with match or if let constructs. However, since this is a bit more complex, I'll use the ? operator for brevity.

Separation of concerns: Consider separating server initialization, request handling, and game logic into different functions. This not only improves readability, but also helps in testing individual components of the codebase.

Improve logging and reporting: Use the log crate for better logging of different events in the application.

Efficiency: Instead of reading the file and updating the board with every move, keep track of the state of the game board in memory and update the file and the memory state when a new move is made.

Cleaner error messages: When errors happen, give the user more context and details about what went wrong. This includes when you fail to parse a move or when a move is not valid according to the rules of the game.

Input validation: Make sure to validate user input. For example, currently, a user could send a request with invalid game name or move data, causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.


The existing code already looks quite efficient and well-structured. However, here are some possible improvements:

Error Handling:
Instead of using .unwrap(), proper error handling should be used. This is more robust and provides more information about potential issues.

Modularize the code:
The main function is quite long and does a lot of different things. It can be broken down into smaller functions for better readability and maintainability. For instance, the request handling part inside the for loop can be moved to a separate function.

Use Constants:
Repeated string literals like "0.0.0.0:8000" and file paths could be replaced with constants.

Avoid excessive file operations:
Each time a move is made, the program reads all moves from the file and updates the board accordingly. This could be optimized by directly updating the board with each move, and using the file just as a record for the moves.

Logging and Debugging:
Consider implementing a proper logging mechanism to record different levels of details for production and debugging scenarios.
